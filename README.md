# AtliQ Hotel Chain - Exploratory Data Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) for AtliQ, an imaginary hotel chain that faced losses in the last quarter. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed booking data to identify areas of poor performance and provide actionable insights.  

## Data Used  
- `dim_rooms.csv`: Room details  
- `dim_hotel.csv`: Hotel details  
- `dim_date.csv`: Date information  
- `fact_bookings.csv`: Booking transactions  
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`: Aggregated booking data  

## Key Insights  
- Imported and explored multi-dimensional data to understand booking patterns and trends.  
- Performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis.  
- Generated actionable insights, such as identifying low-performing hotels and seasonal booking trends, to aid decision-making.  
- Visualized key metrics like occupancy rates and revenue patterns to highlight opportunities for improvement.  .  

## Tools and Libraries  
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
